# Restaurant-Management-Software
I am writing a restaurant management software based on a restaurant that is frequently referenced in American Psycho called 'Dorsia' (I'm a huge fan of the film so you'll get what I mean if you've already watched it). This program is written in python and runs on a Command Line Interface, though I will probably do a GUI version for the program that will be up for release sometime in the future. This program is also integrated with SQL to help with data storage and management.

# Features
This program essentially enables restaurant employes ie: waiters, to be able to add customer reservation, assign tables, and customer orders. For security reasons, this porgram is password protected and can be changed anytime the user likes. 

# How to use
To use this program, you would have to either download the whole repository, or create a pull request. Once that's done make sure to set up a local XAMPP server and import the SQL database into PHPMYADMIN using the .sql file in the repository. If successful, you will then see that I have already created one user account, under the 'users' table. You can either use the credentials I made by default* and log in upon starting up my program. You can also either change the default credentials or create a new one by inserting your desired credentials under the 'users' table, should you choose to do so. I apologize for not coding the create account feature of this program, but I was really pressed on time during the completion of this project. Once that's done the program is then ready to be used.





\*default credentials are listed below:


**username** = admin


**password** = qwerty


Program is open sourced and is coded from scratch by Christopher Andrew.
